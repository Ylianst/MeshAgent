# Project-specific instructions for Claude Code

## Git Workflow

After completing logical chunks of work (fixing issues, implementing features, refactoring), proactively offer to commit the changes with a clear summary of what was accomplished. Don't wait for the user to ask - offer to commit when:

- A feature or fix is complete and tested
- Multiple related changes have been made
- A logical milestone has been reached
- Files have been modified and the work is in a stable state

When offering to commit, briefly summarize what will be committed.
