	<!-- OPTIONAL: May be needed for Duktape JavaScript interpreter and GenericMarshal FFI
	     The Duktape interpreter and FFI system may need to create executable memory pages
	     for certain advanced operations. Testing shows MeshAgent runs without this, but it
	     may be required for specific JavaScript or FFI use cases. Include if you encounter
	     issues with JavaScript execution or FFI functionality. -->
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>
	<true/>

	<!-- OPTIONAL: May be needed if GenericMarshal FFI loads non-Apple libraries
	     The FFI system uses dlopen/dlsym to load libraries dynamically. This allows loading
	     libraries not signed by your Team ID. Testing shows MeshAgent runs without this,
	     but may be required if FFI attempts to load third-party or unsigned system libraries.
	     Remove for better security if not needed. -->
	<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>
	<true/>

	<!-- Note: TCC permissions (Full Disk Access, Screen Recording, Accessibility) are
	     requested at runtime via API calls, NOT via entitlements. They will work correctly
	     for standalone binaries with these minimal entitlements. -->
