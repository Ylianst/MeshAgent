## About

The MeshCentral Agent is the software that runs on remote devices and connects to the MeshCentral server to allow for remote device management. This agent is compiled for Windows, many different Linux distributions, macOS and FreeBSD. In addition compiled for many different processors x86-32, x86-64, ARM, MIPS. For most users, install the MeshCentral server first and install the agent from your server.

## MSH format
The MeshAgent gets it's security and connection instructions from a .msh text file formatted with each line being a "key=value". The .msh file is generally created by the MeshCentral server and, for example, would look like this:

```
MeshName=MyComputers
MeshType=2
MeshID=0xEDBE1BE...
ServerID=D99362D5...
MeshServer=wss://example.com:443/agent.ashx
```

Here is a list of the possible keys that are currently supported by the agent. Note that the key name must have the exact capitalization:

```
AgentCapabilities            Integer Mask, specifying supported Agent Capabilities	
agentName                    If set, this will be sent to the server instead of the hostname
compactDirtyMinimum          Minimum dirty bytes threshold for db.compact() operation
controlChannelDebug          If set, will log/display controlChannel messages (Except for JSON messages)
controlChannelIdleTimeout    Integer value specifying the idle timeout in seconds, to send Ping/Pong to server, to keep connection alive
coreDumpEnabled              If set, a dump file will be written when the agent crashes
disableUpdate                If set, will prevent the agent from self-updating
noUpdateCoreModule           If set, will prevent the agent from taking a new meshcore from the server
enableILibRemoteLogging      Integer value specifying the port number to enable Web Logging. Disabled otherwise
fakeUpdate                   If set, when the agent self-updates, it will update to the same version. Will set disableUpdate upon completion
forceUpdate                  If set, will cause the agent to perform a self-update on next start.
ignoreProxyFile              If set, will cause the agent to ignore any proxy settings
logUpdate                    If set, will cause the agent to log self-update status
jsDebugPort                  Specify a JS Debugger Port
nocertstore                  If set on Windows, will force the Agent to use OpenSSL instead of WinCrypto for cert generation/storage.
remoteMouseRender            If set, will always render the remote mouse cursor for KVM
skipmaccheck                 If set, the agent will not change NodeID on local mac address changes.
showModuleNames              If set, will display the name of modules when they are loaded for the first time
slaveKvmLog                  [Linux] If set, will enable logging inside the Child KVM Process.
WebProxy                     Manually specify proxy configuration
```

Many of these values are used by developers and are not typically used in normal use.

## Special notes for BSD systems
You'll need to mount procfs, which isn't mounted by default on FreeBSD. Add the following line to /etc/fstab
```
proc	/proc	procfs	rw	0	0
```
If you don't reboot, then you can manually mount with the command:
```
mount -t procfs proc /proc
```
In addition, it is recommended to install bash, which you can do with the following command:
```
pkg install bash
```

## Special Note about KVM Support on Linux: 
If you get an error stating that an Xauthority cannot be found, and asking if your DM is configured to use X, 
or if you get a black screen when connecting to the login screen, you may need to: 
* Open /etc/gdm/custom.conf or /etc/gdm3/custom.conf
* Uncomment: WaylandEnable=false.
* Add the following line to the [daemon] section:
```
DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop
```

If you are using LightDM, and the child KVM process unexpectedly closes while connecting to the login screen,
you'll need to:
* Open /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
* Uncomment the following line from the [LightDM] section:
```
user-authority-in-system-dir=false
```


##	Special Note For ChromeOS:
You need to disable rootfs verification, in order to install the meshagent service.
After running the following commands, and rebooting, you should be able to install the meshagent service.
```
sudo su -
cd /usr/share/vboot/bin/
./make_dev_ssd.sh --remove_rootfs_verification
```
The above line will return a warning, but it will tell you the boot partition number, which you 
will need when specifying the above command again, this time with the --partions options. Specify the number instead of (ID)
```
./make_dev_ssd.sh --remove_rootfs_verification --partitions ID
reboot
```
When you are ready to install the agent, you'll need to copy the binary to a path that is not marked noexec, like /usr/local,
so that you can execute the installer from there.

## Self Test
The MeshAgent has the ability to run a self test script, to aid in testing features of the Mesh Agent in consistent/reproducable fashion. 

There are two modes of operation of the self test:
* Stand-alone Mode. This runs the tests in place directly from the command line
* IPC Mode. This opens an IPC to a currently running/installed agent, and runs the tests from there.

The easiest way to run the self tests, is by using Stand-alone mode, as it can be quickly setup and run anywhere. To get started, you will
need make sure that the agent that you will be testing, has successfully connected to the server at least once. This is becuase the self test 
will simulate a server connection with the agent, so the agent will need to be running the meshcore that was pushed by the server, which is 
stored in the db. If the agent has not yet connected with a server, or the meshcore is missing from the .db, the self test will error out 
with a message stating that the meshcore could not be loaded.

Once the agent has successfully connected at least once, simply exit/stop the agent. Make sure that you have placed a copy of the agent-selftest.js
file from the modules folder of the agent repository to the folder where the agent that you wish to test is located. 

To start the test on Windows, from a command prompt, simply run the agent from the command line, with the --selfTest=1 switch:
```
MeshAgent --selfTest=1
```
The self test does not explicitly need an elevated command prompt to run, but some tests, such as the AMT tests require elevated permissions.

To start the test on other platforms, simply run the agent from a console session. It will run best from a GUI capable console session, so that
it can test features such as user consent. If you use SU to elevate the self test, it is best to pass in the -p flag, to preserve the envionment
variables. To start the test, simply run the agent with the --selfTest=1 switch:
```
./MeshAgent --selfTest=1
```

To run the self test in IPC Mode, requires a little more preparation. For security reasons, by default the agent does not allow running 'eval' 
commands thru the IPC channel, however, the Self Test IPC Mode, requires this functionality. The simplest way to allow this command, is to add
the following entry in the msh configuration file of the agent, then restart the agent:
```
debugConsole=1
```

To verify if this flag has been enabled, from the console tab for the agent, run the following command:
```
eval debugConsole
```
If this returns 'true', then you are ready to run the self test in IPC Mode.
To start the self test in IPC Mode, start the self test similarly to how you launch the Stand Alone test, from an elevated console, but add the
following command line switch:
```
--serviceName="xxx"
```
substituting xxx, with the service name of the agent you are trying to test. If you do not know the service name, you can navigate to the folder
that contains the agent, and run the the agent from the command line with the following command line switch:
```
-name
```
This will return the service name for that agent.

After concluding the tests, you can again disable the debugConsole flag by editing the msh configuration file of the agent like the following, and restarting the agent:
```
debugConsole=
```
This will ensure that the debugConsole flag is cleared on the agent. This can be verified by running the following console command, similar to before. It should return false:
```
eval debugConsole
```

## Self Test Coverage
The following is the list of basic tests that the Stand Alone test mode will test:
* Server Initialization. This verifies that the agent sends the correct startup sequence to the server.
* AMT/LMS. If detected, will attempt to verify LMS operation.
* Console command. Verifies that the agent is responsive to performing console commands.
* Basic Telemetry. Verifies the operation of some basic telemetry operations requested from the server.
* Web RTC. Verifies ability to establish Peer Data Channels, and transfer large data chunks.
* Non-English UTF8 Dialog Boxes. Linux specific test to verify capability to display non-english utf8 characters on configurable dialog boxes.
* Tunnel Sessions. Verifies ability of agent to establish tunnel session with server.
* Remote Terminal. Verifies ability of agent to establish terminal session with user-consent.
* Remote KVM. Verifies ability of agent to establish KVM session with user-consent, and verifies receipt of correct KVM packets.
* File Transfer Upload. Verifies ability to upload files, by uploading a random stream of bytes.
* File Transfer Download. Verifies ability to doanload files, by downloading the bytes uploaded in previous test, and verifying CRC.

In addition to the above tests, IPC Mode test adds the following tests:
* Mesh Core Dump Test. Attempts to clear/restart JS core while running KVM test, verifying the agent does not crash. 
* Service Restart Test. Verifies that the agent can successfully restart itself.
